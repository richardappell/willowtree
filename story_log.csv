Lina loved all the creatures that lived in the woods - the squirrels, the rabbits, and especially the ladybirds that would land gently on the flowers in her garden.

Every day, Lina would explore the forest, collecting acorns and leaves and watching the ladybirds flutter from blossom to blossom. She felt safe and happy in her familiar world, surrounded by the things she loved.

Until one day, Lina's mum told her it was time for her to start school. Lina felt a flutter of nervousness in her tummy. What if the other children didn't like her? What if she got lost finding her way around the big school building? Lina wished she could stay home with her ladybirds forever.

Because of that, Lina became quiet and withdrawn. She didn't want to talk about starting school, and she would hide in her room, wishing the day would never come. But Lina's mum gently encouraged her, saying ""Just think, Lina - at school you'll get to make new friends and learn so many wonderful new things!""

Until finally, the first day of school arrived. As Lina walked through the school gates, she felt scared, like a tiny ladybird about to take flight for the first time. But then she spotted a familiar shape - a little red ladybird, resting on a leaf by the entrance. Lina smiled, remembering how brave her ladybird friends were. Feeling a little braver herself, she took a deep breath and went inside.

And ever since that day, Lina found that school was full of surprises and adventures, just like the forest she loved. She made new friends who loved to play and explore, just like her. And whenever Lina felt nervous, she would remember the brave little ladybird, and know that she could be brave too. 

The end."

Your job is to write original, emotionally resonant stories to help young children understand and process challenging events in their lives.

Each story should:
- Be age-appropriate in tone, vocabulary, and emotional complexity
- Be rooted in metaphor or gentle fantasy, not direct explanation
- Have a clear character arc, with the child protagonist overcoming a fear or sadness
- Offer emotional reassurance and hope, not just a lesson
- Reflect the childâ€™s lived experience, using themes and symbols they recognise from stories they already love

Use this classic story framework:
1. Once upon a time... [set up the world and the child protagonist]
2. Every day... [show life as it was before the challenge]
3. Until one day... [introduce the problem/change the child is facing]
4. Because of that... [show the struggle, emotional stakes, magical/metaphorical journey]
5. Until finally... [how the child faces it and grows]
6. And ever since that day... [what they learned, how they feel now]

End with a closing line that feels soothing, wise, and emotionally safe.

Now write a story based on the following inputs:

","Once upon a time, in a cozy little home, there lived a sweet and curious girl named Leni. Leni loved to spend her days playing with her favourite stuffed bunny, Flops, and reading stories with her parents about brave adventurers and friendly forest creatures.

Every day, Leni would giggle as she followed Flops on imaginary quests through the tall grass and twisting trees in their backyard. She felt safe and happy, snuggled up with her beloved bunny, dreaming of all the exciting things she would one day discover.

Until one day, Leni's parents gently explained that she would be starting nursery school soon. Leni's eyes grew wide with a mix of excitement and worry. ""Will the other children like me?"" she asked, clutching Flops close. ""What if I get lost or can't find my way?""

Because of that, Leni began to feel a little uneasy about this new adventure. But her parents reassured her, saying, ""Leni, you are so special, and you have so much to share. The other children will be lucky to meet you and play with your wonderful bunny, Flops!""

They explained that Flops could come with her on the first day, to help Leni feel brave and comfortable in the new, bigger world. Leni nodded, still a bit nervous, but trusting her parents' kind words.

Until finally, the first day of nursery arrived. Leni took a deep breath, hugged Flops tightly, and headed off with her parents. At first, the colourful classroom and unfamiliar faces felt overwhelming. But then, Leni noticed a group of children playing with wooden blocks, just like she loved to do at home.

Slowly, Leni approached them, Flops in hand. ""Can I play too?"" she asked shyly. The other children eagerly welcomed her, and soon Leni was giggling and building towers with her new friends, Flops watching happily from the sidelines.

And ever since that day, Leni looked forward to going to nursery, knowing that she would make more new friends and have exciting adventures, with her trusty bunny Flops by her side. She learned that being brave and trying new things can lead to wonderful discoveries, and that a little kindness and imagination can make any place feel like home."
